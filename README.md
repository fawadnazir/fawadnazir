### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Fawad, and I currently serve as the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) for strategic Financial Services Industry (FSI) accounts at Microsoft ANZ. My career journey has been diverse, spanning various roles. Before joining Microsoft, I held a key leadership position at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), where I contributed to cutting-edge product development. Additionally, I served as the Chief Technology Officer for FSI customers at Telstra.

My versatility shines through my experience as a software engineer, an enterprise architect, a sales professional, and a product leader. My educational background includes a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Australia, along with postgraduate research at Stanford University in the United States. These rich experiences and academic achievements position me as a dynamic leader in the technology landscape.

I love learning and this is really a place where i contribute to the public what i think could be useful. I also run a blog called 'Ramdom Useful Notes' and helped thousands of people with different challanges. [Have a look.](https://randomusefulnotes.blogspot.com/)
